  bio: [
    "I'm a seasoned Senior Developer and Technical Lead at Pabbly Connect, one of the leading workflow automation platforms processing millions of webhooks daily. As the longest-serving developer on the product team, I bring deep institutional knowledge spanning the full technology stack — from low-level web server configuration to high-level architecture decisions.",
    "My work sits at the intersection of full-stack development, DevOps, database engineering, and team leadership. I lead a development team, drive critical infrastructure projects, architect complex systems, and serve as the primary knowledge authority for onboarding and mentoring new engineers.",
    "I'm passionate about building systems that scale — not just in terms of traffic, but in terms of team capability. I believe the best technical leaders don't make themselves indispensable — they make everyone around them capable. That's why I invest heavily in knowledge transfer, documentation, and building systems that are understandable and maintainable by the entire team."

  whatDrivesMe: "Working at the scale of millions of daily webhook executions keeps me sharp. Every optimization matters, every architectural choice has ripple effects, and every production incident is a learning opportunity. This is the kind of engineering challenge that excites me every single day.",
